# Bank Marketing Data Analysis
## Overview
This project explores the BOI Bank Marketing Dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior and trends. Using Python and key libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the data was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to answer specific business questions. The findings can help improve marketing strategies, understand customer demographics, and identify patterns for better decision-making.

## Tools and Techniques
* Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected column names, and removed duplicates for accurate analysis.
* Data Visualization: Created engaging and clear visuals like pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs to showcase findings effectively.

## Key Insights
* A small portion of married individuals is unemployed, which can be a potential focus group for financial products.
